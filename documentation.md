### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure
- **CSS3**: Styling with flexbox and grid for responsive layouts
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language
- **Chart.js**: Library for radar charts and benchmark visualizations
- **LocalStorage API**: For caching assessment results

### Responsive Design

- **Deferred Script Loading**: Loads non-critical scripts after page load
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks key user interactions

## Assessment Flow

1. **Company Context**: Gather information about company type, size, and industry
2. **User Context**: Collect information about user's role and departments
3. **Business Priorities**: Identify key priorities and challenges
4. **Assessment Questions**: Present industry-specific questions about operations and technology
5. **Results & Recommendations**: Display assessment results with visualizations and AI-generated recommendations

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Visualizations

The visualization system uses Chart.js to create interactive charts:

```javascript
// Example of radar chart initialization
function initializeMaturityRadarChart() {
    const ctx = document.getElementById('maturityRadarChart');
    if (!ctx) return;
    
    const radarChart = new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'radar',
        data: {
            labels: ['Operations', 'Technology', 'Strategy', 'Culture', 'Innovation', 'Customer'],
            datasets: [{
                label: 'Your Company',
                data: assessmentData.companyScores,
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(94, 79, 219, 0.2)',
                borderColor: 'rgba(94, 79, 219, 1)',
                borderWidth: 2,
                pointBackgroundColor: 'rgba(94, 79, 219, 1)'
            }, {
                label: 'Industry Average',
                data: getIndustryBenchmarks(assessmentData.industry),
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                borderColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                borderWidth: 2,
                pointBackgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)'
            }]
        },
        options: {
            scales: {
                r: {
                    angleLines: {
                        display: true
                    },
                    suggestedMin: 0,
                    suggestedMax: 100
                }
            }
        }
    });
}
```

### Industry-Specific Questions

The industry questions system dynamically loads relevant questions based on the selected industry:

```javascript
// Example of industry-specific questions structure
const technologyIndustryQuestions = {
    industry: 'technology',
    title: 'Technology Industry Assessment',
    description: 'Questions tailored for software, hardware, and IT service companies',
    questions: [
        {
            id: 'tech-dev-practices',
            question: 'How would you describe your software development practices?',
            options: [
                { value: 'ad-hoc', label: 'Ad-hoc', description: 'No formal process, reactive approach' },
                { value: 'defined', label: 'Defined', description: 'Documented processes with some consistency' },
                { value: 'optimized', label: 'Optimized', description: 'Well-defined processes with continuous improvement' }
            ],
            followUpQuestions: {
                'ad-hoc': [
                    {
                        id: 'tech-dev-practices-adhoc-followup',
                        question: 'What challenges do you face with your current development approach?',
                        options: [
                            { value: 'quality', label: 'Quality Issues', description: 'Frequent bugs and technical debt' },
                            { value: 'speed', label: 'Delivery Speed', description: 'Difficulty meeting deadlines' },
                            { value: 'coordination', label: 'Team Coordination', description: 'Communication and collaboration challenges' }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
};
```

### AI Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine generates personalized insights based on assessment data:

```javascript
// Example of recommendation generation
function generateRecommendations(assessmentData) {
    // Generate summary
    const summary = generateSummary(assessmentData);
    
    // Generate prioritized actions
    const prioritizedActions = generatePrioritizedActions(assessmentData);
    
    // Generate resource recommendations
    const resources = generateResourceRecommendations(assessmentData);
    
    // Generate industry insights
    const industryInsights = generateIndustryInsights(assessmentData.industry);
    
    // Generate maturity roadmap
    const maturityRoadmap = generateMaturityRoadmap(assessmentData);
    
    return {
        summary,
        prioritizedActions,
        resources,
        industryInsights,
        maturityRoadmap
    };
}
```

### Progressive Disclosure

The progressive disclosure system shows relevant follow-up questions based on previous answers:

```javascript
// Example of follow-up question insertion
function insertFollowUpQuestions(followUps, parentQuestionId) {
    // Find the parent question container
    const parentQuestion = document.querySelector(`[data-id="${parentQuestionId}"]`);
    if (!parentQuestion) return;
    
    // Create a container for follow-up questions
    const followUpContainer = document.createElement('div');
    followUpContainer.className = 'follow-up-questions';
    followUpContainer.setAttribute('data-parent', parentQuestionId);
    
    // Generate HTML for each follow-up question
    followUps.forEach(question => {
        const questionElement = document.createElement('div');
        questionElement.className = 'sub-question follow-up';
        questionElement.setAttribute('data-id', question.id);
        
        questionElement.innerHTML = `
            <h4>${question.question}</h4>
            <div class="options-grid">
                ${question.options.map(option => `
                    <div class="option" data-value="${option.value}" data-question="${question.id}">
                        <h4>${option.label}</h4>
                        <p>${option.description}</p>
                    </div>
                `).join('')}
            </div>
        `;
        
        followUpContainer.appendChild(questionElement);
    });
    
    // Insert the follow-up questions after the parent question
    parentQuestion.after(followUpContainer);
}
```
